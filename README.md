# üõ†  FailGuard AI: Predictive Maintenance and Diagnostic Report Generation ‚öôÔ∏è
---

Predict. Protect. Prevent.
FailGuard AI is an intelligent predictive maintenance system that classifies machine failures, diagnoses reasons for failures, and generates expert-level diagnostic reports using LLMs.

---

### Overview
FailGuard AI combines Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to:
- Predict machine failure based on real-time attributes.
- Classify the reason for failure (tool wear, overstrain, power, etc.).
- Generate natural language diagnostic reports automatically for operators and engineers.

It is designed to minimize downtime, prevent unexpected machine failures, and improve maintenance planning
